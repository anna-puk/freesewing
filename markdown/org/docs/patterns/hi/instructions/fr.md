## Notes and tips

When you're using fabric with some stretch in it, it is a good idea to stabilize the seams that go along the whole body, and between the body and the belly, with some stabilizing ribbon.

### Body

Sew the darts on the front of the body closed. Trim away any excess fabric. Sew the tail pieces to the body, matching the notches. Sew the topFin pieces to the body. Sew both parts together, leaving an area below the tail open for stuffing the shark later.

### Belly

Sew the two aboveMouth pieces together along the larger straight side. Sew the teeth to the mouth, matching notches. Sew the darts on the belly, trim away any excess fabric. Sew the aboveMouth pieces to the mouth, matching notches. Sew all of this to the belly piece, matching notches. Sew the bottomFin pieces to the belly, matching notches.

### Completing

Sew the belly to the body, matching the front, back, and fins.

### Filling

Fill the plush toy with stuffing through the opening you left in the tail. Make sure to fill the tail and fins well before adding too much stuffing in the body itself.

Close the toy by hand stitching.
