title: "Hi shark plush toy: Fabric Options"
---

This plush toy is intended to have two different coloured fabrics, one for the upper body, and one for the belly. The mouth should probably have its own colour fabric. Most plush toys have some sort of a faux fur fabric.

Fabrics with a two-way stretch work better than wovens. The stretch should be perpendicular to the grainline.

## Teeth

The teeth have untreated ends, so should be made from a fabric that does not unravel.

## Stuffing

Since this is a pluch toy, it wil need to be stuffed with material.
