title: Schouder tot schouder
---

De afmeting **schouder tot schouder** loopt van de tip van je ene schouder, langs je rug, naar de top van de andere.

To measure your **shoulder to shoulder** find the tip of your shoulder, the tip or corner of the protruding bone that is located where the top of the shoulder meets the side of the arm. It is also where the top of the shoulder seam sits and the sleeve begins on a well-fitting dress shirt. Then, measure from there across your back to the same point at the other side.
