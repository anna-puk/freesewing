When you generate a made-to-measure pattern, you can tweak it endlessly, and export it to a variety of formats, including PDF.  
But it remains ephemeral until you save it to your account, so it becomes one of **your patterns**.

Saving your pattern is optional, but it allows you to re-visit the pattern later, make further tweaks to it or simply download the PDF again.

Vous pouvez enregistrer autant de patrons que vous le souhaitez.

##### Patterns vs Designs

If you came to this site looking for _patterns_ you might have found them under _designs_.
It's not a super important distinction, but it helps to understand that:

- **Design**: One of the styles that we offer. We've got dozens of designs, and you can try them all
- **Pattern**: The result of generating one of those styles into a pattern. Nous avons des milliers de patrons stockés pour nos utilisateurs, et certains pourraient être les vôtres
