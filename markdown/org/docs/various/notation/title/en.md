Each pattern piece has a title that tells you the number and name of the piece, as well as the pattern name and a timestamp of when the pattern was drafted:

<Legend part="title">

Example of a title

</Legend>

<Note>

When you generate a pattern on freesewing.org, the title will also include the name of the person the pattern was made for.
