Now we will use nvm to install Node JS. Run the following command:

```bash
nvm install lts/gallium
```

This will install the so-called LTS version of Node 16 on your system.

LTS versions -- short for Long Term Support -- are good node versions
to use because they are stable and supported for a long time.
