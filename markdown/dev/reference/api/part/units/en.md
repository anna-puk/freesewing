title: Part.units()
---

A part's `units()` method will formats a float you pass it, which should
represent a value in mm, into the units requested by the user.
The returned value is to be used in presentation only, as it will be
a string that includes the user's units.

<Tip>

###### This method is available as shorthand

You can access this units method from the [Part.shorthand](/reference/api/part/shorthand) method:

```js
let { units } = part.shorthand();
```
