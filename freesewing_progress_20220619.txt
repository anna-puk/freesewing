trying to run 'yarn lab' in \designs\ursula initially gave me:

\GitHub\freesewing\designs\ursula>yarn lab
yarn run v1.22.15
$ cd ../../sites/lab && yarn start
$ yarn prebuild && yarn dev
$ SITE=lab node --experimental-json-modules ../shared/prebuild/index.mjs
'SITE' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

'yarn tips' does work, and suggested running 'yarn kickstart' in "the monorepo root"

running 'yarn kickstart' in \GitHub\freesewing\ seems to do the trick:

(see Discord for further errors)















looks like a bug:

yarn run v1.22.15\repos\GitHub\freesewing\designs\ursula>cd ..
$ npx lerna bootstrap && yarn buildall
lerna notice cli v4.0.0\GitHub\freesewing\designs>cd ..
lerna notice filter excluding "component-*"
lerna info filter [ '!component-*' ]ewing>yarn kickstart
lerna info bootstrap root only

(output of yarn kickstart is overwriting older lines in the command window)
